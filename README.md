## Frontend

The frontend communicates with socket.io server assumed to be located in port 1000 on localhost.

Both frontend and backend TypeScript implementation share some interfaces. Those common interfaces are defined in /commonTypes.ts file. Both frontend and backend "projects" include the same file. 

### How to build if you have nodejs and npm:

    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run build

### How to build if you nothing but docker:

    cd frontend
    ./buildWithDocker.sh

### What to do with the build:
Open `frontend/dist/index.html` in your browser. Use arrow keys to move (once movement collision detection has been fixed) and wasd-keys to change rooms (debug feature).

### Development build
If you want to do a development build which automatically updates components when you modify the code, do:

    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run devServe

## Backend
### How to build the placeholder backend nodejs server if you have nodejs and npm:

    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run build

To run it, do:

    cd backend
    node dist/server.js

To run the server in development mode, do:

    cd backend
    npm run dev

## Socket communication

The game contains 48 rooms. There is a channel for each room where the players in that room are (for example `/room34`) and a global room that everyone belongs to (`/global`). When player, for example walks to the edge of a room into another room, the player is removed from the "room's channel" and placed into "the another room's channel". The player is always present in the global channel.

### `commontypes.ts`
Channel names or channel name prefixes are named in `CommChannels`-enumeration.
Event names are named in `CommEventName`-enumeration.
Interfaces are specified for each piece of communication, and the TypeScript backend and frontend use these (=change one side, the other side does not compile until "the interface contract is respected").

### Server functionality
Server stores couple of things in memory:
 * Which player (=socket) is in which room 
 * Newest received player state for each player
 * Last time a monster has died (=collided in player) for all monsters

Communication goes like this:
| Channel | When server receives | What does the server do then? |
| --- |---- | ----|
| - | When server (re)starts | Send `CommEventNames.RequestClientReset` to everyone in the global channel - clients should fully reinitialize. |  
| Global | New connection | Send `CommInitInfo` |
| Global | `CommEventNames.MonsterDeath`| Store the monster death in memory and send the same message to everyone in the Global channel |
| Room-specific | New connection | Add new player's socket into memory. Send list of player counts to everyone (`CommEventNames.MapUpdate`) in the global channel. Send every other player's info who is in the same room (`CommEventNames.PlayerStatusFromServer` / `CommPlayerStateFromServer`) into the room-specific channel. Broadcast all `CommMonsterDeaths` related to this room into the global channel (`CommEventNames.MonsterDeath`) |
| Room-specific | Disconnection | Remove that player/socket from memory. Send `CommEventNames.PlayerRemove` / `CommRemoveOtherPlayerFromServer` to the room-specific channel. Send list of player counts to everyone (`CommEventNames.MapUpdate`) in the global channel. |
| Room-specific | `CommEventNames.PlayerUpdateFromClient` | Update newest player states. Emit `CommEventNames.PlayerStatusFromServer`/ `CommPlayerStateFromServer`to everyone in the room-specific channel. |
| Room-specific | `CommEventNames.ChatMessage`| Emit `CommEventNames.ChatMessage`/ `CommChatMessage`to everyone in the room-specific channel |

## TODO
### Frontend
 - "float tubes"
 - name/rename players
### Backend
 - backend with golang
